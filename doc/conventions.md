## Versioning
### Hardware (board)
Board releases are made with a major and a minor version (e.g. "LEDDs v1.2").

The major version is incremented when making incompatible changes to the board (including simple pin rearrangements). The minor version is incremented for simple fixes or small additions.


## Development and release
### Before starting development
New board versions are developed in a separate branch.

### During development
Every change to the board is documented in [changelog.md](changelog.md).

### Before release
The [release_checklist.md](release_checklist.md) is completed.
